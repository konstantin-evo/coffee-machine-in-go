### Coffee Machine in Go

This is a simple coffee machine simulation written in Go. It allows the user to choose from a selection of coffee
drinks, add sugar and milk, and get a price quote. The program then simulates the coffee-making process and delivers the
finished drink.

This coffee machine simulation is a fun way to learn Go programming and explore the basics of software development. I
hope you enjoy using it!

#### Usage

To run the app, clone the repository and run the `main.go` file using the go run command:

```
git clone https://github.com/konstantin-evo/coffee-machine-in-go.git
cd coffee-machine-in-go
go run main.go
```

This will start the coffee machine simulation, and you will be prompted to choose a drink and customize it with milk and
sugar. Once you have made your selections, the program will display the price of the drink and simulate the
coffee-making process.

#### Coffee Selection

The coffee machine offers the following coffee drinks:

1. Espresso
2. Latte
3. Cappuccino
4. Mocha
5. Americano

Each drink has a unique recipe and price. You can select a drink by entering its corresponding number when prompted.
After selecting a drink, you can customize it by adding sugar, chocolate or cinnamon.

#### Simulating the Coffee-making Process

After you have selected your drink and customized it, the program will simulate the coffee-making process. This includes
grinding the coffee beans, heating the water, and frothing the milk. Once the coffee is ready, the program will display
a message indicating that your drink is ready to be served.
